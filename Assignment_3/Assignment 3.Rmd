## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#required libraries 
library(reshape2)
library(gmodels)
library(caret)
library(ISLR)
library(e1071)

```
#Reading .CSV File and Normalization of the Data
```{r}
UBank <- read.csv("UniversalBank.csv")

UBank$Personal.Loan <- factor (UBank$Personal.Loan)
UBank$Online <- factor(UBank$Online)
UBank$CreditCard<-factor (UBank$CreditCard)
```
#In this step, I will split the data into 60% training and 40% validation.
```{r}
set.seed(20)
training.index<-sample(row.names(UBank), 0.6*dim(UBank)[1])
valid.index<- setdiff(row.names(UBank),training.index)
train.df<-UBank [training.index,]
valid.df <- UBank[valid.index,]
train <- UBank[training.index,]
valiatingtest <- UBank [training.index,]
```
# Question A: Create a pivot table for the training data with Online as a column variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row variable. The values inside the table should convey the count. In R use functions melt()and cast(), or function table(). In Python, use panda dataframe methods melt()and pivot().
```{r}
melted.bank <- melt(train, id=c("CreditCard","Personal.Loan"), variable= "Online")
cast.bank <-dcast(melted.bank,CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online)
cast.bank [,c(1:2,14)]
```
# Question B: Consider the task of classifying a customer who owns a bank credit card and is actively using online banking services. Looking at the pivot table, what is the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer? [This is the probability of loan acceptance (Loan = 1) conditional on having a bank credit card (CC = 1) and being an active user of online banking services (Online = 1)]
```{r}
a=table(train[,c(10,13,14)])
b<-as.data.frame(a)
b
```
# Question C: Create two separate pivot tables for the training data. Onewill have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other will have Loan (rows) as a function of CC. 
```{r}
# I will also be creating a pivot table for Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns).
table(train[,c(10,13)])
#This is the pivot table for Loan (rows) as a function of cc. 
table (train[,c(10,14)])
```

# Question D, Part 1: Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means “the probability ofA given B”]: i.P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors)
```{r}
P1<-table(train[,c(14,10)])
P1
#Answer: 88/(88+212) = 0.29333333
```
#Question D, Part 2: .P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) 
```{r}
P2<-table(train[,c(13,10)])
P2
#Answer: 179/(179+121)= 0.59666667
```
#Question D, Part 3: P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors)
```{r}
P3<-table(train[,10])
P3
#Answer:300/(300+2700)= 0.1
```
#Question D, Part 4: P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) 
```{r}
P4 <-table(train[,c(14,10)])
P4
#Answer: 822/(822+1878)= 0.30444444
```
#Question D, Part 5 P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
```{r}
P5<-table(train[,c(13,10)])
P5
#Answer: 1622/(1622+1078)= 0.60074074
```
#Question D, Part 6 P(Loan = 0)
```{r}
P6<-table(train[,10])
P6
#Answer: 2700/(2700+300)= 0.9
```
# Question E: Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1).
#Answer: 
#Naive Bayes Probability= (P1*P2*P3)/[(P1*P2*P3)+(P4*P5*P6)]
#(0.29333333)* (0.59666667)*(0.1)/(0.30444444)*(0.60074074)*(0.9)
#0.1750222/(0.01750222+0.16460296)
#0.0175022/0.18210518
# Answer = 0.0961105

#Question F: Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?
#Answer: 
#The value obtained fromt the pivot table is 0.0942285 and the value obtained from the naive bayes is O.0961105. These values are almost equivalent to one another. However, the pivot table is a more accurate value. This is because each of the conditional probabilities are manually caluclated one by one.

#Question G: Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)? Run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1). Compare this to the number you obtained in (E).
#In this step, I will perform Naive Bayes on training data
```{r}
table(train[,c(10,13:14)])
training_Naive<-train[,c(10,13:14)]
UBank_NB<-naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~.,data= training_Naive) 
UBank_NB
```
#The value which is obtained is 0.0961105 after running Naive Bayes on data were the value calculated from E is 0.0961105. The two values are exactly the same.
