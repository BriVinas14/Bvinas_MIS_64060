install.packages("dplyr")
Phar<-read.csv("Pharmaceuticals.csv")
install.packages("factoextra")
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
# In my first step, I have read the .csv file and installed the necessary packages and libraries needed in order to complete the assignment.After running the .csv file and labeling it as (Phar), I installed the factoextra and cluster packages and libraries. 

# a) Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.

Phar1<-Phar[,3:11]
head(Phar1)

#Scaling the data of the .csv file.
Phar2<-scale(Phar1)

#Calculating the k value using the Elbow and Silhouette Methods.
fviz_nbclust(Phar2, kmeans, method= "wss") + labs(subtitle="Elbow Method")
fviz_nbclust(Phar2, kmeans, method="silhouette") + labs(subtitle="Silhouette Method")
set.seed(3)
k5<-kmeans(Phar2, centers = 5, nstart = 25)
k5$centers
fviz_cluster (k5, data=Phar2)

#Calculating the KMeans Cluster Analysis and dividing into five different clusters. 
fit<-kmeans(Phar2,5)

#In this step, I will calculate the mean value of all of the numerical variables for each of the five clusters. 
aggregate(Phar2,by=list(fit$cluster), FUN=mean) 

#Adding to the clustering sequence. 
Phar3<- data.frame(Phar2, fit$cluster) 
Phar3

#Here I am going to visualize the cluster plot provided. 
library(cluster)
clusplot(Phar2,fit$cluster,color = TRUE,shade = TRUE, labels= 2, lines=0)

# b.)Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.
#Cluster 1: Rows 3,5,20
#Cluster 2: Rows 1,4,7,10,16,19,21
#Cluster 3: Rows 8,9,12,14
#Cluster 4: Rows 11,13,15,17
#Cluster 5: Rows 2,6,18

# When looking at the mean values for all of the numerical values for each cluster it can be concluded that: 
#Cluster 1 has the lowest Beta, lowest Asset_Turnover
#Cluster 2 has the highest Asset_Turnover, lowest Rev_Growth, highest Net_Profit_Margin
#Cluster 3 has the lowest Market_Cap,highest Beta,lowest PE_Ratio, highest leverage, highest Rev_Growth
#Cluster 4 has the highest Market_Cap, highest ROE, highest ROA, lowest leverage
#Cluster 5 has the highest PE_Ratio, lowest ROE, lowest ROA, lowest Net_Profit_Margin 

# c.) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables? #There is a pattern with the Median_Recommendation Variable given that: 

#Cluster 1 has the lowest Asset_Turnover which results in mostly Moderate Buy Recommendations. 
#Cluster 2 has the highest Net_Profit which results in mostly a Hold Recommendations.
#Cluster 3 has the highest Beta, highest leverage, highest Rev_Growth which results in mostly, a Moderate Buy Recommendations. 
#Cluster 4 has the highest Market_Cap, highest ROE, highest ROA which results in an equal Hold and Moderate Buy Recommendations. 
#Cluster 5 has the highest PE_Ratio which results in mostly Hold Recommendations.

#Can we see a certain pattern among the clusters with the variables (10 to 12)?

#Clusters 1,3 have mostly Moderate Buy Recommendations.
#Clusters 2,5 have mostly Hold Recommendations. 

#d.) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

#Cluster 1 has the lowest Beta, lowest Asset_Turnover
#Cluster 2 has the highest Asset_Turnover, lowest Rev_Growth, highest Net_Profit_Margin
#Cluster 3 has the lowest Market_Cap,highest Beta,lowest PE_Ratio, highest leverage, highest Rev_Growth
#Cluster 4 has the highest Market_Cap, highest ROE, highest ROA, lowest leverage
#Cluster 5 has the highest PE_Ratio, lowest ROE, lowest ROA, lowest Net_Profit_Margin
