#Here, I will set the seed for kmeans.

#Thus, K= 5, meaning that there will be 5 clusters. 
```

```{r}
#Clustering the data from .csv file. 
custclus<-kmeans(cust1,5)
custclus
#Now, I will visualize the clusters. 
ggplot(cust1, aes(x = Annual.Income..k..,y = Spending.Score..1.100.)) +geom_point(stat = "identity", aes(color=as.factor(custclus$cluster)))+ scale_color_discrete(name="k",breaks=c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),labels=c("Cluster1", "Cluster2","Cluster3", "Cluster4", "Cluster5"))+ ggtitle("Customer Segmentation")
#Thus, the following can be concluded:
#Cluster 1 are customers who earn a medium annual income and have a medium annual spending rate. 
#Cluster 2 customers who have a high annual income and a low annual spending rate. 
#Cluster 3 costumers who have low annual incomes and a high annual spending rates.
#Cluster 4 customers with high annual incomes and have high annual spending rates. 
#Cluster 5 shows that customers with low annual incomes and low annual spending rates.
